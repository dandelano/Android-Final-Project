# Android-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Android programming class. It is an app that allows you to 
store the description of movies on your tablet. You can add new movies to your database by searching by the title of the movie and saving the result to the local storage for later viewing. The search function uses themoviedb.org api to retrieve descriptions, cover images, and home page urls if available.
